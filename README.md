# AI Soccer Game – Game Theory Simulation

Welcome to AI Soccer Game, a fun simulation built with Python + Pygame + Tkinter that explores game theory concepts in soccer.  
You control Team A (Human), while Team B (AI) tries to outsmart you using simple strategic behaviors (chasing, scattering, defending).  

---

## Features
- Human-controlled player (arrow keys + space to kick).  
- AI-controlled players with chasing & random scatter strategy.  
- Soccer ball physics with friction and realistic movement.  
- Goal detection with scoring system.  
- Customizable win conditions (choose how many points to win).  
- Graphical simulation using Pygame + Tkinter pop-ups.  

---

## Controls
- Up, Down, Left, Right arrows → Move your player.  
- Space + direction key → Kick the ball.

## Game Theory Angle
This project demonstrates strategic decision-making:
- AI players chase the ball or scatter randomly to simulate unpredictability.  
- Human player must decide between attacking vs. defending.  
- Win conditions mimic payoff structures in simple game theory models.
